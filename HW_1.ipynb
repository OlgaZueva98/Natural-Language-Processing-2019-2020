              "['The biggest source of frustration with the sequel to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them relates to it being a middle installment of a much larger story. As such, it’s a stepping stone from the introduction into a meatier narrative. It lacks its own individuality, not having much of a story to tell. Unlike its predecessor, which offered a self-contained tale within a larger framework, The Crimes of Grindelwald is all about world-building and getting viewers ready for what is yet to come. (According to what I have read, screenwriter J.K. Rowling and director David Yates are planning a five-movie arc.) Assuming the pentalogy has a satisfactory conclusion, it’s easy to see The Crimes of Grindelwald working better as a single chapter in a completed series than as a stand-alone big budget holiday motion picture. Despite being light in the story department, The Crimes of Grindelwald offers plenty of small pleasures and tightens up the linkage between this series and Harry Potter. The most obvious is the introduction of a younger, mid-1920s version of Albus Dumbledore, with Jude Law taking on the role that was first essayed by Richard Harris then, after his death, Michael Gambon. There’s also a visit to Hogwarts, which doesn’t look sufficiently different in 1925 than it would 75 years later. Rowling, who has always exceled in her ability to craft interesting backstories, expends much of the movie developing the murky politics on both side of the Atlantic during the interwar period. It’s no coincidence that the main villain, the diabolical dark wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp), is played with more than a passing nod to Hitler: charismatic and charming when he needs to be but driven by megalomaniacal and genocidal impulses. His goal is straightforward: not only allow the wizards to come out of hiding but give them dominion over the world. Muggles have their uses but only as subjects of the pure-bloods. He insists he is a force for peace, showing a future-projection of what the humans will do if left in charge: World War II and the atomic bomb. The major characters from the first film are back although their roles have been marginalized. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is still the putative lead. He spends the first half of the film trying to locate his quasi-love interest from the first film, Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), and, once he has found her, helping her in her quest to learn the true identity of the mysterious Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller). Newt is acting as an agent for Dumbledore and we learn bits about his history, especially as it involves his time at Hogwarts and his relationship with Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz). Muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and his ditzy mind-reading girlfriend Queenie (Alison Sudol) are along for the ride (most of the time), although her willingness to accept Grindelwald’s poisonous message creates a rift. The characters are little more than pawns in a larger chess match where the kings are unquestionably Dumbledore and Grindelwald, once “closer than brothers” and now (as we know from Harry Potter lore) destined to battle one another. The best moments in The Crimes of Grindelwald are the character-based ones. For a movie that wallows in spectacle – there are a lot of gorgeous special effects sprinkled throughout the 135-minute running time – it’s ironic that the smaller, more intimate scenes have the most impact. Redmayne and Waterston re-ignite the spark that made their interaction delightful in the first film. There’s enough sense of regret to inject a dose of pathos into the triangle formed by Newt, Leta, and Newt’s brother, Theseus (Callum Turner). Scenes inside Newt’s briefcase provide comedic respite but, for the most part, the “fantastic beasts” of the title are limited to cameos. Most of the action sequences are high on razzle-dazzle and low on tension and excitement. The hijacking of the airborne prison-carriage near the beginning looks great but is devoid of suspense. Likewise, there’s no real sense of danger in the final struggle where blue and orange flames duel. One problematic aspect of the movie is the introduction of Credence and his beloved Nagini (Claudia Kim). Their story is inelegantly inserted at odd and awkward places because the purpose of the climax and denouement relates to Credence’s identity. There’s not enough time to effectively develop them and, as a result, the “big reveal” is more a point of curiosity than anything else. Don’t expect many gasps. The returning actors – Redmayne, Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, and Zoe Kravitz – slide nicely back into their roles. This time, however, they have less to do. This is especially true of Redmayne. Although the Fantastic Beasts saga is designed as his story, he’s left mostly as an observer to events in this segment. Jude Law is instantly recognizable as Dumbledore – he has the air of assurance he radiated in all of the Harry Potter movies. And those who worried that Johnny Depp was going to ruin Fantastic Beasts can breathe a sigh of release. Depp is restrained and contained. His performance is chilling without being over-the-top. There’s not a hint of Captain Jack to be found. I ended my review of the first movie by praising the stand-alone aspects of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them but questioning its ability to extend into a longer series. My reaction to The Crimes of Grindelwald is the opposite. The movie does an excellent job assembling pieces and preparing viewers for the larger picture but disappoints in its ability to stay focused and provide a reason why this film needs to be seen now. Harry Potter fans will no doubt be enthralled by this diversion but others may be a little frustrated that it’s going to be two years before the next act in this play is revealed.',\n",
              " 'The name of J.K. Rowling’s website for her ever-widening Wizarding World is, aptly enough, Pottermore. The seven Harry Potter novels have been expanded into eight films and countless other iterations, and now we are deep into the Fantastic Beasts prequels, the screenplays for which are all J.K. Rowling’s work but not adaptations of existing books – so the possibilities for more Potter lore are infinite. The Crimes of Grindelwald is the second of five projected Fantastic Beasts films, and in itself mimics the form of the expanding Potter universe: what might have been a simple quest film opens up continually to offer more detail. You sense that Rowling enjoys inventing creatures, spells and mythology on the fly, with barely enough room in this frenetic film to fit them all in. There’s an initially fearsome cat-dragon that turns out to be as easily placated as a kitten. There’s an epic family saga written in verse that may be the key to a crucial question, but each time it is brought up it is swatted aside – who has time to read storybooks? – and is ultimately sunk by RMS Titanic, no less. The film is set largely in Paris, in 1927, with the denouement in Père Lachaise cemetery. Between the magical flourishes and shameless placement of famous landmarks, it is a beautifully drawn world. The interiors are baffling, though, thanks to the film’s exemplary CGI work, as almost every one extends into infinite floors and rooms. A simple terraced house sits on a cavernous basement, which conceals a vast lake. This befuddling parade of Potterishness, including a nostalgic excursion to Hogwarts, is powered by a corresponding excess of plot. The narrative mechanics are frequently bewildering, and ultimately exasperating. Especially as by the end, little has progressed, reminding us that this bottomless adventure is just a small step on hero Newt Scamander’s path. Wizard Newt, played quietly and awkwardly by Eddie Redmayne, is an exceptionally gawky misfit. He has an affinity with beasts, which cram into his appropriately capacious suitcase, but takes a diffident approach to interpersonal relationships and conflict. One plot strand sees him overcoming his reluctance to “take a side” when confronted with the blatant evil of villainous, pureblood wizard Grindelwald (a growling Johnny Depp). It’s Newt’s Casablanca moment – although it’s early, the spectre of World War II is ever-present. But that storyline is subsumed into several others, key among them the torturous quest by poor Credence Barebone (a hunched Ezra Miller) to discover his true identity. Grindelwald’s crimes are evident, but despite the title, hardly dwelt on. There’s a scrap of a love story too, but it’s a sibling theme that dominates, with fraternal pairs separated and at odds. Even when Jude Law’s twinkle-eyed Dumbledore, controversially revealed as gay by Rowling, alludes to his once close bond with Grindelwald, it is in entirely chaste terms. This is a seductively beautiful film, directed by Potter veteran David Yates and populated by astonishing creatures (the tiny Niffler is a wonder), gorgeous period production design and exquisite costuming – but each time it grows, it feels a little emptier.',\n",
              " 'The first Fantastic Beasts movie felt like a standalone adventure, even though it was promoted as a five-movie series from the get-go. Not everyone liked it, but I thought it was an enjoyable adventure that also served to expand the world of the Harry Potter universe — or the Wizarding World, as we’re now to call it. Unfortunately, this first sequel can’t keep that up. Here’s where the five-movie arc really kicks in, and the film suffers for it. Normally I’d explain the plot round about now, but, frankly, I can’t be bothered. It entirely spins out of what transpired in the first movie',\n",
              " \"Perhaps it's because of Johnny Depp, J.K. Rowling feeding us bullshit all the time, or both, but I didn't care that much about Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. I didn't even bother watching the trailer. I went to see it anyway because I've seen all the Harry Potter movies and Steve McQueen's Widows was not an option in my theater. Following the events of its predecessor, the film begins with the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escaping from custody with the aid of his followers, most of which are not aware of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over everyone, magical and non-magical beings. In an effort to stop Grindelwald, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne).  The biggest problem this film has is the plot. It's not terrible, there just isn't one. All the film does is feeding us information as if its only purpose was to set upcoming films in the series. Because of this, it's difficult if not impossible to tell what the film is about. But there's more, it doesn't make a lot of sense most of the time and not so many appealing things happen, so the film ends up being dreadfully tedious —I was struggling to stay awake five minutes into the film, I was super awake during the break, and when the film restarted, I started struggling again. The characters are just as unappealing. They introduce so many new characters, none of them gets enough screen time nor the development they deserve. The result is shallow, paper thin new characters, and inconsistent old ones —Tina, for instance, was a strong woman and Auror in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\"]"

            "﻿The biggest source of frustration with the sequel to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them relates to it being a middle installment of a much larger story.\n",
            "As such, it’s a stepping stone from the introduction into a meatier narrative.\n",
            "It lacks its own individuality, not having much of a story to tell.\n",
            "Unlike its predecessor, which offered a self-contained tale within a larger framework, The Crimes of Grindelwald is all about world-building and getting viewers ready for what is yet to come.\n",
            "(According to what I have read, screenwriter J.K. Rowling and director David Yates are planning a five-movie arc.)\n",
            "Assuming the pentalogy has a satisfactory conclusion, it’s easy to see \n",
            "The Crimes of Grindelwald working better as a single chapter in a completed series than as a stand-alone big budget holiday motion picture.\n",
            "Despite being light in the story department, The Crimes of Grindelwald offers plenty of small pleasures and tightens up the linkage between this series and Harry Potter.\n",
            "The most obvious is the introduction of a younger, mid-1920s version of Albus Dumbledore, with Jude Law taking on the role that was first essayed by Richard Harris then, after his death, Michael Gambon.\n",
            "There’s also a visit to Hogwarts, which doesn’t look sufficiently different in 1925 than it would 75 years later.\n",
            "Rowling, who has always exceled in her ability to craft interesting backstories, expends much of the movie developing the murky politics on both side of the Atlantic during the interwar period.\n",
            "It’s no coincidence that the main villain, the diabolical dark wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp), is played with more than a passing nod to Hitler: charismatic and charming when he needs to be but driven by megalomaniacal and genocidal impulses.\n",
            "His goal is straightforward: not only allow the wizards to come out of hiding but give them dominion over the world.\n",
            "Muggles have their uses but only as subjects of the pure-bloods.\n",
            "He insists he is a force for peace, showing a future-projection of what the humans will do if left in charge: World War II and the atomic bomb.\n",
            "The major characters from the first film are back although their roles have been marginalized.\n",
            "Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is still the putative lead.\n",
            "He spends the first half of the film trying to locate his quasi-love interest from the first film, Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), and, once he has found her, helping her in her quest to learn the true identity of the mysterious Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller).\n",
            "Newt is acting as an agent for Dumbledore and we learn bits about his history, especially as it involves his time at Hogwarts and his relationship with Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz).\n",
            "Muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and his ditzy mind-reading girlfriend Queenie (Alison Sudol) are along for the ride (most of the time), although her willingness to accept Grindelwald’s poisonous message creates a rift.\n",
            "The characters are little more than pawns in a larger chess match where the kings are unquestionably Dumbledore and Grindelwald, once “closer than brothers” and now (as we know from Harry Potter lore) destined to battle one another.\n",
            "The best moments in The Crimes of Grindelwald are the character-based ones.\n",
            "For a movie that wallows in spectacle – there are a lot of gorgeous special effects sprinkled throughout the 135-minute running time\n",
            "–\n",
            "it’s ironic that the smaller, more intimate scenes have the most impact.\n",
            "Redmayne and Waterston re-ignite the spark that made their interaction delightful in the first film.\n",
            "There’s enough sense of regret to inject a dose of pathos into the triangle formed by Newt, Leta, and Newt’s brother, Theseus (Callum Turner).\n",
            "Scenes inside Newt’s briefcase provide comedic respite but, for the most part, the “fantastic beasts” of the title are limited to cameos.\n",
            "Most of the action sequences are high on razzle-dazzle and low on tension and excitement.\n",
            "The hijacking of the airborne prison-carriage near the beginning looks great but is devoid of suspense.\n",
            "Likewise, there’s no real sense of danger in the final struggle where blue and orange flames duel.\n",
            "One problematic aspect of the movie is the introduction of Credence and his beloved Nagini (Claudia Kim).\n",
            "Their story is inelegantly inserted at odd and awkward places because the purpose of the climax and denouement relates to Credence’s identity.\n",
            "There’s not enough time to effectively develop them and, as a result, the “big reveal” is more a point of curiosity than anything else.\n",
            "Don’t expect many gasps.\n",
            "The returning actors – Redmayne, Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, and Zoe Kravitz – slide nicely back into their roles.\n",
            "This time, however, they have less to do.\n",
            "This is especially true of Redmayne.\n",
            "Although the Fantastic Beasts saga is designed as his story, he’s left mostly as an observer to events in this segment.\n",
            "Jude Law is instantly recognizable as Dumbledore –\n",
            "he has the air of assurance he radiated in all of the Harry Potter movies.\n",
            "And those who worried that Johnny Depp was going to ruin Fantastic Beasts can breathe a sigh of release.\n",
            "Depp is restrained and contained.\n",
            "His performance is chilling without being over-the-top.\n",
            "There’s not a hint of Captain Jack to be found.\n",
            "I ended my review of the first movie by praising the stand-alone aspects of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them but questioning its ability to extend into a longer series.\n",
            "My reaction to The Crimes of Grindelwald is the opposite.\n",
            "The movie does an excellent job assembling pieces and preparing viewers for the larger picture but disappoints in its ability to stay focused and provide a reason why this film needs to be seen now. \n",
            "Harry Potter fans will no doubt be enthralled by this diversion but others may be a little frustrated\n",
            "that it’s going to be two years before the next act in this play is revealed.\n",
            "The name of J.K. Rowling’s website for her ever-widening Wizarding World is, aptly enough, Pottermore.\n",
            "The seven Harry Potter novels have been expanded into eight films and countless other iterations, and now we are deep into the Fantastic Beasts prequels, the screenplays for which are all J.K. Rowling’s work but not adaptations of existing books –\n",
            "so the possibilities for more Potter lore are infinite.\n",
            "The Crimes of Grindelwald is the second of five projected Fantastic Beasts films, and in itself mimics the form of the expanding Potter universe: what might have been a simple quest film opens up continually to offer more detail.\n",
            "You sense that Rowling enjoys inventing creatures, spells and mythology on the fly, with barely enough room in this frenetic film to fit them all in.\n",
            "There’s an initially fearsome cat-dragon that turns out to be as easily placated as a kitten.\n",
            "There’s an epic family saga written in verse that may be the key to a crucial question, but each time it is brought up it is swatted aside – who has time to read storybooks?\n",
            "–\n",
            "and is ultimately sunk by RMS Titanic, no less.\n",
            "The film is set largely in Paris, in 1927, with the denouement in Père Lachaise cemetery.\n",
            "Between the magical flourishes and shameless placement of famous landmarks, it is a beautifully drawn world.\n",
            "The interiors are baffling, though, thanks to the film’s exemplary CGI work, as almost every one extends into infinite floors and rooms.\n",
            "A simple terraced house sits on a cavernous basement, which conceals a vast lake.\n",
            "This befuddling parade of Potterishness, including a nostalgic excursion to Hogwarts, is powered by a corresponding excess of plot.\n",
            "The narrative mechanics are frequently bewildering, and ultimately exasperating.\n",
            "Especially as by the end, little has progressed, reminding us that this bottomless adventure is just a small step on hero\n",
            "Newt Scamander’s path.\n",
            "Wizard Newt, played quietly and awkwardly by Eddie Redmayne, is an exceptionally gawky misfit.\n",
            "He has an affinity with beasts, which cram into his appropriately capacious suitcase, but takes a diffident approach to interpersonal relationships and conflict.\n",
            "One plot strand sees him overcoming his reluctance to “\n",
            "take a side” when confronted with the blatant evil of villainous, pureblood wizard Grindelwald (a growling Johnny Depp).\n",
            "It’s\n",
            "Newt’s Casablanca moment\n",
            "–\n",
            "although it’s early, the spectre of World War II is ever-present.\n",
            "But that storyline is subsumed into several others, key among them the torturous quest by poor Credence Barebone (a hunched Ezra Miller) to discover his true identity.\n",
            "Grindelwald’s crimes are evident, but despite the title, hardly dwelt on.\n",
            "There’s a scrap of a love story too, but it’s a sibling theme that dominates, with fraternal pairs separated and at odds.\n",
            "Even when Jude Law\n",
            "’s\n",
            "twinkle-eyed Dumbledore, controversially revealed as gay by Rowling, alludes to his once close bond with Grindelwald, it is in entirely chaste terms.\n",
            "This is a seductively beautiful film, directed by Potter veteran David Yates and populated by astonishing creatures (the tiny Niffler is a wonder), gorgeous period production design and exquisite costuming –\n",
            "but each time it grows, it feels a little emptier.\n",
            "The first Fantastic Beasts movie felt like a standalone adventure, even though it was promoted as a five-movie series from the get-go.\n",
            "Not everyone liked it, but I thought it was an enjoyable adventure that also served to expand the world of the Harry Potter universe — or the Wizarding World, as we’re now to call it.\n",
            "Unfortunately, this first sequel can’t keep that up.\n",
            "Here’s where the five-movie arc really kicks in, and the film suffers for it.\n",
            "Normally I’d explain the plot round about now, but, frankly, I can’t be bothered.\n",
            "It entirely spins out of what transpired in the first movie; having not seen that since it was in cinemas over two years ago, I frequently struggled to keep up, scrounging around in my memory for the ins and outs of a story I didn’t realise I needed to thoroughly revise.\n",
            "That’s to say nothing of all the other stuff it dregs up from the depths of Harry Potter mythology.\n",
            "As a fan of that series, who’s seen the films multiple times and what have you, I have a fair idea\n",
            "what it’s all about, but even I was frequently left feeling confused.\n",
            "I pity casual viewers.\n",
            "Sometimes movies can gloss over this kind of stuff\n",
            "— the mythology and backstory enriches it, but there’s still an adventure to be going on with — but \n",
            "The Crimes of Grindelwald doesn’t seem to work that way.\n",
            "The adventure is tied up in the previous film and the overall backstory, and that generates a lot of tedious exposition to explain how things are connected.\n",
            "But that exposition is sometimes rushed over, apparently to allow time for some empty spectacle\n",
            "—\n",
            "there’s still plenty of CGI-fuelled magic action here\n",
            ", it just doesn’t seem to have any weight in the story, or what weight it should have is unclear.\n",
            "It doesn’t help that the film feels jumpy, like loads of little bits and pieces have been chopped out.\n",
            "I’m not surprised there’s an extended cut, which hopefully will smooth some of that out.\n",
            "It probably stems from the film having so many characters and stories to juggle.\n",
            "The downside of making the previous film feel standalone is that most of its characters need to be reintroduced and reconnected to each other; at the same time, there are new characters and storylines being introduced and set in motion; all while also trying to deliver an action-adventure movie.\n",
            "There’s stuff to appreciate here nonetheless, including likeable returning characters, some appreciable additions\n",
            "(Jude Law is good as a young Dumbledore), and some impressive effects (the spectacle may be empty, but\n",
            "sometimes it’s still spectacular).\n",
            "Fans of the world J.K. Rowling has created will appreciate getting to see more of it,\n",
            "too —\n",
            "in this case, it’s wizarding Paris, albeit briefly —\n",
            "although there are also some additions to the mythology that are of questionable value.\n",
            "Well, there are three more films yet to come\n",
            "that may reveal that Rowling has somewhere to go with them.\n",
            "Indeed, I wonder if Crimes of Grindelwald will ultimately play better once it’s placed in context with the following instalments.\n",
            "Or maybe it really is a bit of a mess, with too much going on and not enough time or space to do it, which sometimes makes it hard to understand the significance or value of what we’re watching.\n",
            "I hope that it’s at least put all the pieces in place now, so the next three films can move forward with fewer problems.\n",
            "Perhaps it's because of Johnny Depp, J.K. Rowling feeding us bullshit all the time, or both, but I didn't care that much about Fantastic Beasts:\n",
            "The Crimes of Grindelwald.\n",
            "I didn't even bother watching the trailer.\n",
            "I went to see it anyway because I've seen all the Harry Potter movies and Steve McQueen's Widows was not an option in my theater.\n",
            "Following the events of its predecessor, the film begins with the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escaping from custody with the aid of his followers, most of which are not aware of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over everyone, magical and non-magical beings.\n",
            "In an effort to stop Grindelwald, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne).  \n",
            "The biggest problem this film has is the plot.\n",
            "It's not terrible, there just isn't one.\n",
            "All the film does is feeding us information as if its only purpose was to set upcoming films in the series.\n",
            "Because of this, it's difficult if not impossible to tell what the film is about.\n",
            "But there's more, it doesn't make a lot of sense most of the time and not so many appealing things happen, so the film ends up being dreadfully tedious —I was struggling to stay awake five minutes into the film, I was super awake during the break, and when the film restarted, I started struggling again.\n",
            "The characters are just as unappealing.\n",
            "They introduce so many new characters, none of them gets enough screen time nor the development they deserve.\n",
            "The result is shallow, paper thin new characters, and inconsistent old ones —Tina, for instance, was a strong woman and Auror in Fantastic Beasts and\n",
            "Where to Find Them; in here, she is a mere love interest and sidekick.\n",
            "How disappointing!\n",
            "Also, there isn't much of a connection between the characters which makes the film even more confusing.  \n",
            "The acting is a tiny bit better.\n",
            "Eddie Redmayne is annoying as always but at least he does a decent job as Newt Scamander, conveying his eccentricities very well and still making the character very likeable.\n",
            "Ezra Miller has potential but unfortunately, he's buried under the dreadful script and\n",
            "there's really nothing he can do.\n",
            "Jude Law somehow manages to do a good job and he is believable as the young Albus Dumbledore.\n",
            "As for Johnny Depp, the dude yet again does what he always does when his role requires a lot of makeup.\n",
            "Fantastic Beasts:\n",
            "The Crimes of Grindelwald doesn't even work comedy-wise either.\n",
            "While there's still plenty of humour throughout to balance the dark tones of the film, it just isn't that effective.\n",
            "Most of the jokes are recycled from the first film and because of it, they don't work.\n",
            "And when they do work, they are nothing but chuckles —I wasn't the only one to feel this way, everyone at my screening did.  \n",
            "Visually, however, the film is beautiful.\n",
            "The special effects are incredible, the cinematography, although I was not a fan of some camera movements and close shots, is very nice, and the costumes, sets and makeup are great. \n",
